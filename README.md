Practice app to learn GraphQL on the front and back ends.  To get it started I followed [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ed8SzALpx1Q).

Besides GraphQL, it uses MongoDb and Mongoose on the backend, with React and Apollo on the front-end.

For styling, I used [Styled Components](https://www.styled-components.com/) and [Polished](https://polished.js.org/).
